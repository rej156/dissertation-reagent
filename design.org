Stage 1-8
For each id (ID = Core Value tag)
You parse the current state of each core Value
On the screen you'd display the final parsed state of the core value (i.e. Add
a goal for Career or whatever)
On every turn/user input, increment the counter and parse the next core value
finite state machine
(Only 3 at a time)

For the third option, if the mood score hasn't been assessed for awhile,
Display the option to rank your mood
Start intervention loop if user chooses to improve mood

[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Range 3 out of the above array
Parse the first core Value
Occupy the first and second option for example with:
1) Add a new goal for Career
2) Add the next baby step for goal "XYZ" in Career
3) - Add a new goal for finances?

Score = 1
Vision = 2
Goal = 3
If no 3s, only display one create a goal option
Based on how many 3s there are,
    Add a step for that nth goal
Step = 4

Increment counter for range 3 base
